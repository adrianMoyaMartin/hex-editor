Add a file named "to-read" inside the "to-read" folder then run the program, this should read its hex and create a new file named "hex.txt" which will let you edit it, when you are ready, save this file and it will produce a new file called "result" with the edited data.

To change the file type please go into main.rs and edit "ENDING" to any file type
